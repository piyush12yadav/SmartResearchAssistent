üöÄ Smart Research Assistant Application

üìñ Description:

The Smart Research Assistant Application is a Java-based Spring Boot project designed to assist researchers in their research endeavors. The application allows users to submit research requests, which are then processed by a backend service that retrieves relevant information from a Gemini API. The application provides a user-friendly interface for submitting requests, tracking progress, and retrieving results.

The Smart Research Assistant Application is built using Maven and has a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct layers. The application is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to maintain.

‚ú® Features:

1. **Research Request Management**: Users can submit research requests with detailed information, including the topic, keywords, and specific requirements.
2. **Gemini API Integration**: The application integrates with the Gemini API to retrieve relevant information, such as research papers, articles, and other sources.
3. **Real-time Tracking**: Users can track the progress of their research requests in real-time, including the status of the request, the number of matches found, and the relevance of the results.
4. **Result Retrieval**: Users can retrieve the results of their research requests, including a list of matching sources, abstracts, and relevant information.
5. **Search Filtering**: The application provides advanced search filtering capabilities, allowing users to narrow down their search results based on specific criteria, such as publication date, author, and relevance.
6. **User Authentication**: The application includes user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manage research requests.
7. **Error Handling**: The application includes robust error handling, providing users with detailed error messages and troubleshooting tips.
8. **Logging and Monitoring**: The application includes logging and monitoring capabilities, allowing developers to track performance, debug issues, and optimize the application.
